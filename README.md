# Intelligent Customer Support Chatbot

In today‚Äôs digital-first world, customer support is a crucial aspect of any business. As customer bases grow and expectations for quick and effective service increase, traditional customer support systems are struggling to keep up. Human agents often face limitations in terms of availability, speed, and consistency‚Äîleading to long wait times, repetitive questions, and overall dissatisfaction for users.

## üí° Project Overview

This project aims to develop an **intelligent chatbot** capable of providing automated customer support. The chatbot will go beyond traditional rule-based systems by using advanced natural language processing and machine learning to understand and respond to customer queries effectively.

## üö© Problem Statement

- Traditional support systems are not scalable.
- High cost and effort in hiring and training human support agents.
- Limited availability due to time zones, shift scheduling, and agent burnout.
- Repetitive tasks such as:
  - Password resets
  - Account detail inquiries
  - Delivery tracking

These common requests consume time and resources that could be better utilized for complex, high-priority issues.

## üéØ Goals

- Automate repetitive customer support tasks.
- Provide 24/7 availability without relying solely on human agents.
- Reduce wait times and improve response consistency.
- Enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- NLP-powered intent recognition and contextual responses.
- Smart fallback to human agents when needed.
- Integration with backend systems for tasks like:
  - Account lookup
  - Order tracking
  - Password resets
- Multi-platform support (Web, Mobile, Social Media).
- Analytics and insights dashboard for monitoring usage and performance.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React / Vue / Chat UI Framework
- **Backend**: Node.js / Python / Express
- **NLP & AI**: OpenAI GPT / Rasa / Dialogflow
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker / AWS / Azure
